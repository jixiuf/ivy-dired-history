* Notices
I don't use Helm/Ivy any more, and code in this repos has not changed for sevreal
I use https://github.com/karthink/consult-dir now

* Use ivy to open recent directories

[[http://melpa.org/#/ivy-dired-history][http://melpa.org/packages/ivy-dired-history-badge.svg]]
------------

 it is integrated with `dired-do-copy' and `dired-do-rename'.
 when you press C (copy) or R (rename) , it is excellent to
 allow users to select a directory from the recent dired history .

* Installation:
The easiest way to get started is to install the package via [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (package-install 'ivy-dired-history)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (require 'savehist)
 (add-to-list 'savehist-additional-variables 'ivy-dired-history-variable)
 (savehist-mode 1)
;; or if you use desktop-save-mode
;; (add-to-list 'desktop-globals-to-save 'ivy-dired-history-variable)


(with-eval-after-load 'dired
  (require 'ivy-dired-history)
  ;; if you are using ido,you'd better disable ido for dired
  ;; (define-key (cdr ido-minor-mode-map-entry) [remap dired] nil) ;in ido-setup-hook
  (define-key dired-mode-map "," 'dired))
#+END_SRC
